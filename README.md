Typescript Friendly React Hooks for the Fully Kiosk Browser App

This library exposes multiple react hooks that you can use to interface with your Fully Kiosk Browser App. By default the fully kiosk API is globally injected into the window object, so you could use it directly. However, this library provides a more typescript friendly interface.

## How it works

## Installation

Using `npm`:

```sh
npm install fullykiosk
```

or if you prefer to use the `yarn` package manager:

```sh
yarn add fullykiosk
```

## Usage

```ts

```
